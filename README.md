This is a simple habit tracker web app I built to help users stay consistent with their daily habits. The main idea behind this project is to track habits along with a proper streak system instead of just counting clicks.

Project Description
The app works completely on the frontend and stores data in the browser using localStorage, so each user has their own separate data.
### The Problem statement
People often fail to maintain daily habits because they cannot clearly track their consistency over time. Existing basic task apps focus only on daily completion and do not properly track streaks or long-term progress.

This project aims to solve that by providing a simple habit tracker with smart streak tracking.

### The Solution
To solve this problem, I built a simple Habit Tracker web application that focuses on consistency rather than just daily task completion.

The app allows users to create their own habits and mark them as completed each day. Instead of simply counting how many times a button is clicked, the system checks the date and automatically calculates a streak based on consecutive days. If a day is missed, the streak resets. This makes the tracking more meaningful and realistic.

The application stores data in the browser using localStorage, so users don’t need to sign up or log in. Each person using the app has their own separate data stored on their device.

The goal of this solution is to keep things simple, easy to use, and focused on helping users build discipline through visible streak progress.
