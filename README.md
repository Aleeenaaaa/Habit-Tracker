Habit Tracker

This is a simple habit tracker web app I built to help users stay consistent with their daily habits.
The main idea behind this project is to track habits along with a proper streak system instead of just counting clicks.
The app works completely on the frontend and stores data in the browser using localStorage,
so each user has their own separate data.

MY PROJECT

Users can add their own daily habits

Habits can be deleted anytime

Users can mark a habit as completed

The app automatically calculates streaks

A small dashboard shows total and completed habits

The streak logic is based on date comparison. If a habit is completed on consecutive days,
the streak increases. If a day is missed, the streak resets.

DATABASE:
This project does not use a backend or database.
All data is stored in the browser using localStorage.
That means,Data stays even after refreshing the page
Each user has separate data
No shared data between different devices
